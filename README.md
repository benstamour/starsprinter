Sci-Fi Store Website
====================

This repository includes the code for a responsive website for a fictional sci-fi store (a crew of treasure hunters selling rare items on a spaceship called the *Starsprinter*), made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, and Bootstrap. This project involved me working a lot with PHP and building and querying relational databases using MySQL, and I worked on making the site unified and appealing as well as functional; there's a search catalogue with pagination and sortable results, a login system, the ability for users to add items to a cart and "purchase" them, and the administrative ability to add and edit items to the catalogue.

The code in this repository has removed the ability to access the SQL databases, but the code involving SQL and the databases is still viewable.
